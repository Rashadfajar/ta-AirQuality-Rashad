# Air Quality Data Analisis dan Visualisasi Dashboard
This project aims to analyze air quality data covering PM2.5 concentration and meteorological factors influencing air pollution fluctuations in Guanyuan, China, during the period from March 1, 2013, to February 28, 2017. The dataset used contains hourly information about air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, and meteorological variables such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, and precipitation. The primary goal of this analysis is to identify patterns that can help anticipate the risk of air pollution and understand the factors contributing to PM2.5 fluctuations.

# Features
1. **Hourly PM2.5 Pattern**: Visualizes the average PM2.5 levels by hour of the day to identify high-risk time periods.
2. **Meteorological Factors Analysis**: Explores the correlation between PM2.5 and various meteorological factors such as temperature, rainfall, pressure, dewpoint, and wind speed.
3. **Data Summary**: Provides key statistics about the PM2.5 data, including average, maximum, minimum, and dataset dimensions.
5. **Insightful Notes**: Highlights important observations about the PM2.5 concentration patterns and the influence of meteorological factors.
